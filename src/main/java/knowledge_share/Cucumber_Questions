Questions
=========
1. What is Cucumber?
Cucumber is a testing framework that supports Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). It allows you to write test
cases in a natural language format, known as Gherkin, which is easily understandable by non-technical
stakeholders.

2. What are the key components of Cucumber?
The key components of Cucumber are:
1. Feature files written in Gherkin syntax
2. Step definitions written in programming languages such as Java, Ruby, or JavaScript
3. Runner classes to execute the feature files
4. Hooks for setup and teardown operations
5. Tags to organize and run specific scenarios or features

3. What is Gherkin syntax?
Gherkin is a business-readable, domain-specific language used to describe the behavior of a software application
in a structured format. It consists of predefined keywords such as Given, When, Then, And, and But, which help
in writing scenarios in a human-readable format.

4. What are the advantages of using Cucumber for testing?
Some advantages of using Cucumber for testing include:
1. Improved collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders
2. Easy-to-understand feature files facilitate clear communication and documentation
3. Reusability of step definitions across different scenarios
4. Integration with various programming languages and testing frameworks
5. Ability to generate reports for test results and coverage analysis

5. How do you write a scenario in a feature file?
Scenarios in feature files are written using Gherkin syntax. Each scenario typically consists of a title,
followed by steps using Given, When, Then, And, or But keywords to describe the behavior being tested.

6. Explain the concept of tags in Cucumber.
Tags are annotations used to organize and filter scenarios or features. They can be added to feature files,
scenarios, or individual steps. Tags are prefixed with the '@' symbol and can be used to mark scenarios for
different purposes such as smoke testing, regression testing, or to specify the environment.

7. What are step definitions?
Step definitions are the implementation of the steps described in feature files. They are written in programming
languages like Java, Ruby, or JavaScript and are responsible for executing the corresponding actions or
validations when a step is matched during test execution.

8. How do you parameterize steps in Cucumber?
Steps can be parameterized by using placeholders in Gherkin syntax, typically enclosed within angle brackets.
These placeholders can then be passed as arguments to step definition methods. For example, Given I have
<number> cucumbers can be matched with @Given("I have {int} cucumbers") in the step definition.

9. Explain the concept of background in Cucumber.
Background is a feature in Cucumber that allows you to specify steps that are common to all scenarios in a
feature file. These steps are executed before each scenario in the feature file, reducing duplication and
improving readability.

10. How do you handle data tables and scenario outlines in Cucumber?
Data tables and scenario outlines are used for parameterization and data-driven testing in Cucumber. Data
tables are used to pass tabular data to steps, while scenario outlines allow you to define a scenario template
that can be executed with different sets of data.

11. What are the keywords used in Gherkin syntax?
Common keywords include:
1. Feature: Defines a high-level application feature.
2. Scenario: Describes a specific user behavior within a feature.
3. Given: Defines preconditions before the scenario starts.
4. When: Describes the action taken by the user.
5. Then: Describes the expected outcome after the action.
6. And: Combines multiple steps within a scenario.

12. How do you handle data-driven testing with Cucumber?
Cucumber supports data tables in feature files to provide multiple sets of data for a scenario. Step
definitions can access this data using libraries like DataTable.

13. What are hooks in Cucumber, and how are they used?
Hooks are methods that run before or after scenarios (or entire features) for setup/teardown or logging
purposes.

14. How do you handle errors and exceptions in Cucumber tests?
Java exception handling mechanisms can be used within step definitions. Assertions from libraries like
JUnit can verify expected behavior.
